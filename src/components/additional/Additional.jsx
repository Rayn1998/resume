            Have no difficulties with teaching new
            technologies, got to become lead
            specialist previously and have trained a
            group of people with matchmove
            techniques on a project. I've decided
            change the field of employment because
            i like to create something new from
            scratch and see how it helps other
            people through their experience via
            interacting with applications
